**Redirect to wiki.gg** is a browser extension that automatically redirects you from wikis that are forked/abandoned from Fandom to wiki.gg. It will also adjust Google's search results to try and populate the wiki instead of Fandom's SEO.

The extension is available on these browsers:
- [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/redirect-to-wikigg/oecpcjdcedociegkjmlcepigjaenkenj)
- [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-to-wikigg/cngoemokfjekjkmajenlaokhnmmiinca)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirect-to-wiki-gg/)


Wikis that are considered independent. There is a separate "[Indie Wiki Buddy](https://github.com/KevinPayravi/indie-wiki-buddy)" extension available for Chrome and Firefox that you can use alongside **Redirect to wiki.gg**.
